# Thodar Railways 

## Overview

Thodar Railways is a comprehensive, console-based Java application designed to simulate the core backend operations of the Indian Railway ticket booking system (similar to IRCTC).

The project follows a modular, feature-based Clean Architecture and uses a Singleton in-memory repository pattern for storing application data. With the latest updates, the system focuses strictly on high-performance core railway operations.

The application supports:

* User onboarding and role-based access (Admin / Passenger)
* 60-Days Advance Reservation Period (ARP) bulk scheduling
* Dynamic train routing and automated paired-train generation
* Quota-based ticket booking (GNWL, PQWL, TQWL)
* Real-time waitlist and RAC auto-upgrades upon cancellations
* Integrated financial wallet and robust transaction tracking
* Support helpdesk and daily revenue analytics

# Project Information

* **Project Name:** Thodar Railways
* **Language:** Java (JDK 8+)
* **Architecture Style:** Feature-Based MVC / Clean Architecture
* **Data Storage:** In-Memory Repository (Singleton Pattern)
* **Entry Point:** Main.java
* **Package Root:** `com.sathish.thodar`

---

# High-Level Architecture
The project is structured using a decoupled Clean Architecture, separating Data, Business Logic, and UI/Presentation.

## 1. View / Feature Layer ( `features/`)

Handles user interactions, console I/O, and feature-specific workflows.

### Examples

* AuthView
* AdminView
* PassengerView
* BookingView
* RouteView
* NotificationView
* ReportView
* SupportView
* FileView

---

## 2. Core Business Logic Layer (`features/core/`)

Acts as the brain of the application, handling complex railway operations independently of the UI.

### Examples

* TrainService

    * Waitlist Logic
    * Quota Distribution
    * Capacity Calculation
    * Route Validation
    * Seat Allocation

---

## 3. DTO Layer (`data/dto/`)

Manages structural entities and transfers data securely between layers to prevent tight coupling.

### Entities

* User
* Station

### Enums

* Role
* ScheduleStatus
* TicketClass
* TicketQuota
* TicketStatus
* TransactionStatus
* TransactionType

### Requests

* BookingRequest
* TrainSetupRequest
* ScheduleRequest
* LoginRequest
* RegisterRequest

### Responses

* PassengerListResponse
* AuthResponse
* LiveStatusResponse
* TicketSummaryResponse
* Transaction

---

## 4. Repository Layer (`data/repository/`)

Centralized in-memory persistence using the Singleton pattern.

### Examples

* ThodarDB
* StationMaster
